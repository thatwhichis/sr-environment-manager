# sr-environment-manager

This 2019 Python Code Sample (src/SR_EnvironmentManager.py) was generated as part of an interview process to demonstrate basic functionality of a larger scale project that would help Artists and Technical Artists more quickly/easily configure the environment variables of their workspaces for various projects. Python was a requirement of the project.

Some decision insight into the code sample can be found in the base directory [README.txt](https://github.com/thatwhichis/sr-environment-manager/blob/master/README.txt) that was provided with the sample.
